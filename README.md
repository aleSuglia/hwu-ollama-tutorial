# Ollama Tutorial

This repository is designed to teach students how to use [https://ollama.com/](Ollama) via the
official [https://github.com/ollama/ollama-python](Python API).

## Installation

To get started, you need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running the Scripts

### Interacting with an LLM: `llm_client.py`

To run the script, use the following command:

```bash
python llm_client.py
```

This script demonstrates the basic usage of the Ollama API for text-only LLMs.

### Script 2: `vlm_client.py`

To run the second script, use the following command:

```bash
python vlm_client.py
```

This script provides an example of how to run vision+language models that are available in Ollama.
